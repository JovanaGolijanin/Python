# This function takes in a game state, the current depth of the search tree, and the player who is currently making a move (either "max" or "min"). The function returns a list containing the best move for the player as well as its associated score.

# The game_over() function should return True if the game is over, and False otherwise. The get_possible_moves() function should return a list of possible moves that the player can make in the current game state. Each move should be a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of the two squares that the player is placing their pieces on. The evaluate() function should return a score for the given game state, with a higher score indicating that the "max" player is doing better and a lower score indicating that the "min" player is doing better.
